I strongly agree with first habit, because it's really important to maintain healthy lifestyle as a programmer, to take regular break from sitting and looking on screen, do at least some basic exercise and drink lot of fluids.
Even though I don't have much experience i can relate with this point, since I was also trying to customize some parts of the code, that took lot of hours, but in the end it didn't make any difference.
Again I have to agree with the third point. It's important to keep code as simple as possible. Especially if somone else will work with this code.
