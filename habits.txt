I strongly agree with first habit, because it's really important to maintain healthy lifestyle as a programmer, to take regular break from sitting and looking on screen, do at least some basic exercise and drink lot of fluids.
Even though I don't have much experience i can relate with this point, since I was also trying to customize some parts of the code, that took lot of hours, but in the end it didn't make any difference.
Again I have to agree with the third point. It's important to keep code as simple as possible. Especially if somone else will work with this code.
I would say, that it's really hard to get into 'the zone', because for most people it's almost impossible to have such a long period of time without being interupted, especially when it's so easy to get distracted.
It's really important to move forward and learn new things all the time, since programming is very dynamic segment and while most people don't like to learn, it makes huge difference.
Collaboration is one of the most important things in programming, because while solving problem alone can be helpful and it's more satisfying, it also takes a lot of time and in the end finishing the whole code sooner is much more satisfying, than solving a single problem.
